# Causal Experiments Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-07-07  
**Analyst**: Claude Code Assistant  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis and improvement of causal discovery experiments in the tabpfn-extensions project

## Executive Summary

I have conducted a thorough analysis of all causal discovery experiments in the `causal_experiments` folder.

All code appears to be legitimate research software with no malicious content detected.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ All experiments are well-designed and scientifically sound
- ‚úÖ Good use of checkpointing and error handling
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive utility modules with proper separation of concerns
- üîÑ Some experiments had minor code quality issues that I improved
- üìà Created improved versions where beneficial while preserving all functionality
